# Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to PushEx! PushEx is currently in an early stage and your contributions are very appreciated.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, the maintainers should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Different types of contributions are appreciated here. This can range from contributing code, writing tutorials, improving documentation, submitting bug reports, submitting feature requests, or asking questions on usage.

# Ground Rules

Responsibilities
* Ensure cross-version compatibility for every change that's accepted (OTP & Elixir versions supported).
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Follow semver for changes. Any breaking changes should be avoided when possible.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Getting started

For each change:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. Ensure test coverage for your changes
4. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
  * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project
  * Note the PushEx Code of Conduct
  * Send a pull request clearly describing your change and the reasoning for it

# How to report a bug

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email sb8244@cs.ship.edu and support@salesloft.com instead.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of PushEx are you using?
2. What did you do?
3. What did you expect to see?
4. What did you see instead?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in PushEx, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process

Issues and Pull Requests will be followed up in a timely manner by the core maintainers. You can expect feedback within one week, although that is not guaranteed. After feedback has been given we expect to maintain timely correspondence on the issue to keep momentum. We may close the pull request if it does not show activity.
